For the wine Linux & MacOS compatibilty layer to work, you MUST compile the wrapper library.
You will need to have wine and wine-tools installed to compile the wrapper.

To do this, you will need to run the following commands.

Linux:
```
cd bridge
winegcc -shared -o ../assets/winepipebridge.dll.so bridge_unix.c bridge_unix.spec -fshort-wchar
```

MacOS:
```
cd bridge
winegcc -shared -o ../assets/winepipebridge.dll.dylib bridge_unix.c bridge_unix.spec -fshort-wchar
```


If this program is not compiled, wine compatibilty will not work
